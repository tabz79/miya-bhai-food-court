🧠 CONTEXT:
You are building the website for Miya Bhai Food Court, a legendary Hyderabadi food brand with multiple branches and a cult following.
This is not a generic restaurant—it’s a cultural institution with deep Nizami roots, a street-meets-royalty vibe, and a bold identity.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Build a mobile-first, photo-centric, and modular React + Tailwind CSS website that:

Reflects Hyderabadi/Nizami heritage in its design

Supports multi-branch discovery

Allows in-house ordering (CTA only for now)

Includes table booking (CTA only for now)

Is SEO + LLM (ChatGPT/Gemini) optimized

Uses non-hardcoded content, fully editable from /data folder

🔧 TECH STACK:
React + Vite

Tailwind CSS

lucide-react for icons

Folder structure: /components, /pages, /data, /assets

🏗️ STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
🧱 Modular Components (Must):
All content (text, images, menus, branches, story, contact) must be externalized in /data/ folder (e.g., /data/menu.js, /data/story.js)

Components must be reusable and accept props or pull from data files

No hardcoded values inside components (except minor static UI text)

Allow future developer to update ANYTHING (logo, text, addresses, food items, images) without touching JSX

✅ CORE FEATURES:
🎨 1. Branding & Cultural Design:
Visual theme inspired by Old City Hyderabad, Nizami architecture, Irani cafés, and modern street food culture

Color palette: zaffran yellow, biryani brown, charcoal black, jade green, ivory white

Typography: Urdu/Nastaliq-style headers + modern sans-serif for body

🗺️ 2. Dynamic Branch System:
Support for unlimited branches

Each branch has: name, address, hours, contact, Google Maps link

Data should come from /data/branches.js or similar

Optional: custom menu per branch (structure for future)

🍽️ 3. Dynamic Menu System:
Menu structured by category (e.g., Biryani, Tandoori, Beverages)

Each item has: name, image, price, tags (spicy, veg, bestseller, etc.)

Store data in /data/menu.js

Menu grid layout with category filters and responsive design

🏠 4. Home Page:
Hero section with rotating food images + text + CTAs

"Miya Bhai Story" block (pull from /data/story.js)

Highlights block: “Why Miya Bhai?” (editable selling points)

Featured dishes carousel or grid

CTAs: Order Now, Book Table, Find Nearest Branch

Preview of top branches (with links to full branch page)

🔍 5. SEO & AI Discoverability:
Add schema.org markup (@type: Restaurant, Menu, FAQ)

Use semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer, etc.)

Add editable FAQs in /data/faqs.js

Set meta tags, OpenGraph tags, and mobile-first optimizations

Sitemap + robots.txt placeholders

💼 6. Static Pages:
/menu: full menu with filters

/branches: all branches with map view (static or embed)

/about: story, legacy, values, team (from /data/story.js)

/catering: B2B, events, contact form stub

/order: CTA placeholder page

/book: table booking form (basic stub)

/contact: map + contact info + social links

/terms, /privacy: placeholders

📱 Responsive UX:
Design should be mobile-first

Sticky bottom navbar for mobile: Home, Menu, Order, Book, Contact

Smooth scrolling, fast load time, lazy-loaded images

🚫 DO NOT:
❌ Hardcode menu, story, branches, or contact info inside JSX

❌ Use Bootstrap or generic Western design templates

❌ Nest all logic in single giant files—modularize everything

❌ Skip responsiveness or schema markup

❌ Store static image paths inside component code

🧪 OPTIONAL (Future Stubs):
WhatsApp ordering integration

Razorpay/Stripe integration

Customer reviews per branch

Loyalty program

Delivery dashboard

🔚 FINAL NOTE:
This is a living project. Everything must be easy to modify later by a developer—text, structure, logic, and design. Use best practices for scalability.
